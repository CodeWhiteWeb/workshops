### React Basics :
> - State : The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
>- Hooks : It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
>- Props : React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object. 

### Canvas

  - components : WebGL renderer, camera, scene, etc

### Cannon Js
#### Three Js and Ammo Js based Physics Engine
- Lightweight than many ported physics engines.

- Uses an iterative Gauss-Seidel solver to solve constraints.

#### Ammo Js
- Bullet Physics Engine
Bullet is a physics engine which simulates collision detection, soft and rigid body dynamics
 'ammo' stands for "Avoided Making My Own js physics engine by compiling bullet from C++"
